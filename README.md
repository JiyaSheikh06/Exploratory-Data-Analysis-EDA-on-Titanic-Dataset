# Titanic - Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)

This project explores the Titanic passenger data using Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA). The goal is to uncover insights such as survival rates and the impact of various factors like gender, age, and class.

## Dataset
The dataset is available on [Kaggle](https://www.kaggle.com/c/titanic/data) and consists of two CSV files:
- `train.csv`: The training dataset used for model building.
- `test.csv`: The test dataset used for model evaluation.

## Steps
1. **Data Loading**: The dataset is loaded using Pandas.
2. **Data Cleaning**: Handle missing values and correct data types.
3. **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)**:
   - Analyze survival rates based on different features such as gender, age, and class.
   - Generate visualizations like bar plots, histograms, and pie charts to summarize findings.
4. **Visualization**: Visualize key insights using Seaborn and Matplotlib.

## Dependencies
- Python 3.x
- Pandas
- Seaborn
- Matplotlib
- Jupyter Notebook
